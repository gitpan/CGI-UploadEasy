CGI-UploadEasy version 1.00
===========================

CGI::UploadEasy is a wrapper around, and relies heavily on, CGI.pm.
Its purpose is to provide a simple interface to the upload
functionality of CGI.pm.

At creation of the CGI::UploadEasy object, the module saves one or
more files from a file upload request in the upload directory, and
information about uploaded files is made available via the fileinfo()
method. CGI::UploadEasy performs a number of tests, which limit the
risk that you encounter difficulties when developing a file upload
application.
